# Brain Data 101 🧠📊  

This is my first neurotech/data science project!  
It shows a very simple example of how to visualize **neuron firing rates over time** using Python.  

---

## 🔍 What it does
- Creates a small dataset of neuron activity (time vs firing rate).  
- Loads the data into a pandas DataFrame.  
- Plots a line chart showing neuron firing rate over time.  

---

## 🛠 How to run
1. Make sure you have Python installed.  
2. Install the libraries if needed:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib
